# HELP!

A friend of yours is getting married, but the site they used to track their wedding plans went out of business.

The failed startup was kind enough to send them a data dump, but it's in a crazy nested hash in a ruby file.

They've asked you to help them decipher the data, and answer some questions.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repo (no need to fork).
1. Look at the data in `people.rb`
1. Check out `00_example.rb` for an example of what to do (basically, just `puts` things out
1. Go through each file and complete the exercise
1. Rejoice!
