# Parsing HTTP Responses

When you make a request to a server, you get back a response which is essentially a text file in a predictable format.

Your mission is to create a class called HttpResponse (test-driven) that can parse these HTTP responses. Every HTTP response is setup in the same way:

* The first line contains the status code (Ex: HTTP/1.1 200 OK)
* There is always a blank line in between the list of headers and the body

This class must:

* Take a string when it is initialized. This string is a valid HTTP response. Examples below.
* Have a `headers` method that returns a hash of headers, where the strings are keys
* Have a `body` method that returns the entire body (and nothing else)
* Have a `status_code` method that returns only the integer representing the status code

Note the following:

* Use the Sample HTTP Responses below to setup your tests and expectations
* You do not have to have your class return a "live" HTTP response
 
If you finish that before the warmup is done, please

* add a method named `response_json` that will return a Ruby hash of the body if the Content-Type is json (returns nil otherwise)
* update the `headers` method to return a hash with all lowercase symbols - so `:content_type` instead of `"Content-Type"`
* create a method that will save the HTML to a file in the `/tmp` directory and open it it in the browser if the content type is `text/html`
