Iterating through dogs (and owners)
===

This exercise is intended to get some practice iterating through
arrays with complex hashes. Please do not modify any constants you see
or try and cheat by just returning and array with those hashes hand
written.

To run:

```bash
gem install rspec
rspec --color dogs_spec.rb
```

To focus on a test, just add the line number like:

```bash
rspec --color ./dogs_spec.rb:9
```

Good luck!
