Implement a function that takes two arguments. The first argument is an array of numbers. The second argument is a number two compare with each item in the array. Your function should return an array of numbers that are greater than the second argument.

Example:

```
findGreater([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8], 5);
// => [6,7,8]
```
