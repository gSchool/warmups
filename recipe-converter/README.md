Recipe Converter Warmup
===

Implement a RecipeConverter class that satisfies the following requirements:

The class is initialized with a list of the ingredients to convert. That list is an array of hashes. The key of the hash is a string that is the name of the ingredient. The value is number of grams of the ingredient needed.

There is a method called ‘to_tablespoons’ that returns an array of hashes. The key is still a string that is the name of the ingredient. The value is now the number of tablespoons of the ingredient needed. There are 15 grams to a tablespoon.

There is also a method called ‘to_cups’ that returns an array of hashes. The key is still a string that is the name of the ingredient. The value is now the number of cups of the ingredient needed. There are 16 tablespoons to a cup.
