// Compare two strings by comparing the sum of their letter-Values (char-Value).
// For comparing treat all letters as UpperCase.

// Empty and null-Strings should be treated as they are equal.
// If the string contains other characters than letters, treat the whole string as it would be empty.

// Examples:

// "AD","BC" -> equal

// "AD","DD" -> not equal

// "gf","FG" -> equal

// "zz1","" -> equal

// "ZzZz", "ffPFF" -> equal

// "kl", "lz" -> not equal

// null, "" -> equal
