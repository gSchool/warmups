User-Validation Warmup
===
Hello, I am the product owner at your company and I need you to start on the following stories for me... Please make sure all of your code is tested. Both feature and models specs.
I need these done in 30 minutes, too!

1. Create a new rails app called store-warmup

2. A user can register for the site from the homepage
  - a user must have a name
  - a user must have a valid and unique email address (something@something.com)
  - a user must have a valid role ('buyer' or 'seller')

None of the above fields can be blank.
