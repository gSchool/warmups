// Create a function mostLikely which compares two probabilities, returning true if the first one is most likely otherwise false.
// For this exercise probability is expressed as two numbers separated by a colon e.g. a probability of 1 in 3 will be 1:3.
// So:
// mostLikely('1:3','1:2') will return false as 1 in 3 is less likely than 1 in 2.

function mostLikely() {
  //your solution here
}
